PART I: AI-POWERED WORKLOAD OPTIMIZATION
This section details the predictive and prescriptive capabilities of Green Matrix designed specifically for AI and Machine Learning workloads.
1. Simulate Performance
This module predicts the performance of AI models on various hardware configurations, enabling users to make informed decisions before deployment. The simulation accounts for both Inference and Training tasks.
1.1 Datasets
1.1.1 Inference Dataset
A comprehensive dataset was created by merging two distinct sources: the MLPerf Inference dataset and a proprietary Benchmarking Inference dataset.
•	MLPerf Dataset: A collection of benchmark suites from MLCommons, used to fairly evaluate ML systems across tasks like image classification, object detection, and NLP.
•	Benchmarking Dataset: Created by running a custom script against various hardware using inputs like the MLPerf dataset to maintain integrity.
Model-specific information (Framework, Total Parameters, etc.) was collected via another custom script and merged. Hardware-specific data was also collected from various sources. To enhance the data's effectiveness, additional feature columns were engineered. The final dataset includes:
•	Model: Name of the AI model.
